h1. What is yeli?

yeli is a small and very simple app written in flask ( A Python MicroFramework), which will pull the latest version of your git repo from github.com to your server

h1. How does this work

when you push code to github, it sends a POST request to the configured WebHook URL.
yeli will be listening to POST requests from github servers and will run "git pull" , simple right ?

h1. How to setup

* you need to have your cloned repo from github on your server atleast for the first time .( if its a private repo checkout deploy keys in github)
* install flask "pip install flask"
* place yeli.py in your repository directory ( on server)
* run python yeli.py
* On the Github page go to a repository, > “Admin”, “Service Hooks”, 
“Post-Receive URLs” and add the url of your machine (e.g. http://example.com:5000).
